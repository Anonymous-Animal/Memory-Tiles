## Project Topic:

A memory tile game that has incremental difficulty.

## Project Pitch:

We would like to create a memory tile game that a user can use to help train their memory skills.
The game will involve a set grid of tiles that are face-down and just like the classic game memory,
the user will have to match a pair by flipping two tiles at a time. 
The unique implementations will include being able to increase the diffulty of the game, to keep score of
correct matches and even have a turn limit while playing the game. 

Our suggested stretch goals were to also include the ability to play against another player, to
include effects on some of the tiles that will affect the user's score in some way and lastly,
the ability to change the rule of the game (as a difficulty).

This will be achieved through an easy-to-use, fun and interactive interface.
We will include styling that has a great use of colors while maintaining a clean and professional look.
We like the idea of producing a game, but one that positively influences your brain is even better.
