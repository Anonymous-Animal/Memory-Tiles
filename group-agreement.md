# Group Agreement

## Communication plan

### How will your group communicate with each other
* Remotely
  * Slack
  * Phones
  * GitHub
* Team Level
  * Respectfully
  * Make plans for the day before we start 
  * When giving advice: teach vs tell 
  * Strive to help each other out
      * Get comfortable asking for help 
  * Gracefully
      * avoid criticism
          * negative 
          * unproductive 
          * abusive 
          * unnecessary 
  * Try to stay on topic
      * new ideas can go in comments on docs or github 


### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to

* Directional meeting so we can set up our agenda
    * Use turn speaking: Everyoneâ€™s input is heard 

## Conflict plan

### What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
  * Professionally
  * Group vote
      * If tie
        * Rock Paper Scissors
        * Flip a coin 
        * Can opt to escalate to Instructor Team
  * Personal accountability
  * When the environment of the group starts getting heated
    * suggest breaks
    * crack a joke, even a bad joke
    * joke pile
      * index cards of jokes in the middle of the table for people to grab
    * hug Aeone's plush cat

## Work plan

### How you will identify tasks
* Identify milestones based on requirements and user stories

### How will you assign tasks, know when they are complete, manage work in general (In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions. Each person is working on "meaty" problems)
* Based on strength/comfort level/challenge 
  * try to balance all three so that we have a good learning experience
* Project board and project cards on github
* Pair programming based on balance of strength/comfort level/challenge
* Group code review 
  * Ensure these are structured in our daily schedule - daily goals, etc

## Git process

### What is your Git flow
* Only work on branches
  * New branches for new tasks
    * backtrack branch specific
  * Plan out which branches can be made with group
  * NOBODY touches the master - David will stab you, metaphorically
* Make sure code is structured, modular, partitioned, and scoped well 

### How many people must review a PR
* Non-Functional change PR (syntax, etc)
  * One person
* Functional change PR 
  * Group review
* Communication agreement on PR
  * Let us know what is going on with the code before you leave
  * Give us permissions that we need to work on it
  * Let us know what your plan is 

### Who merges PRs
* Not the coder!
* Designated daily leader 
    * Group communication first
    
## Anything else you feel is important

### expectations around work times
* bulk of the day 
  * here together
  * private room here
  * somewhere else all four of us? 
  
### standup times 
* meet before we start work that day
  * planning meeting 
* w/ Instructor: 9:30 - 10:00 / 16:00 

### taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
* see conflict planning
* 15 minute rule for seeking help
